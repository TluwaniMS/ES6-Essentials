# ES6-Essentials

## 1. Javascript Hoisting
Hoisting is when the Javascript file interpreter moves all the functions, variables, and class declarations to the top of the file before any of the code is executed.
## 2. [Javascript Scopes](https://github.com/TluwaniMS/Guide-Of-Javascript-Scopes)
## 3. [Javascript Variable Declarers](https://github.com/TluwaniMS/Javascript-Variable-Declarers)
## 4. [Javascript Higher Order Array Functions](https://github.com/TluwaniMS/Javascript-Higher-Order-Array-Functions)
## 5. [Javascript Arrow Functions](https://github.com/TluwaniMS/Javascript-Arrow-Functions)
## 6. Javascript Sets

A Javascript `set` is an object/collection of unique elements.

* creating a `set`:
* creating a `set` from an array:
* adding an element to a `set`:
* looping a `set`:

## 7. Javascript Default Function Parameters

`Default Function Parameters` serve as initialised arguments that represent default values, that can be used in case no arguments are passed when calling a function.

## 8. Javascript Array Methods

* `concat()`:

The `concat()` method is used to join two array and return only one

* `indexOf()`:

The `indexOf()` method is used to identify the index of an element in an array

* `includes()`:

The `includes()` method is used to check if an array includes a specified element

* `join()`:

The `join()` method is used to join all the elements in an array and return them as a single string

* `push()`:

The `push()` method is used to add new elements to the end of an array

* `splice()`:

The `splice()` method is used to either add or remove elements from an array

## 9. Javascript Destructuring

* How to access object properties:
* How to access object properties and assign a new name to them:
* How to access object properties and assign a new name to them and a default parameter:

## 10. Javascript Template Literals

`Template literals` use backticks  ` `` ` and not quotes `("...")` to create a string;

It allows for one to use various punctuation marks and reference variable values in the string with ease.

## 11. Javascript Switch Statements

The javascript `switch` statement is used to execute/trigger specific functions depending on the conditions that have been given.

## 12. Javascript Ternary Operators

The `Ternary operator` is a simplified/shortened way of writing out a conditional operator `if/else`

## 13. Javascript Spread Operators

The `Spread operator` allows us to join array elements  or object properties into another array or object

## 14. Javascript Promise

A Javascript `Promise` is a representation of a value/data that is still to be.

* `Producing Code`:

Code that is responsible for getting the required values/data

* `Consuming Code`:

Code that must wait for the producer to deliver the required data to be consumed or perform the defined data manipulations

A `Promise` is a Javascript object that links producing and consuming code.

## 15. Javascript setTimeout

The `setTimeout()` method allows the calling of a function, after a certain amount of time

## 16. Javascript setInterval

The `setInterval()` allows us to run a function after a set period of time repeatedly.
