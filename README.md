# ES6-Essentials

## 1. Javascript Hoisting
Hoisting is when the Javascript file interpreter moves all the functions, variables, and class declarations to the top of the file before any of the code is executed.
## 2. Javascript Scopes
There are 3 types of scopes in Javascript:
* The Global Scope:

This refers to variables declared outside of a function, these variables can be accessed from anywhere within the file.
* The Function Scope:

This refers to variables that are declared inside/within a function; these variables can only be accessed within the function.
* The Block Scope:

This refers to functions that are declared inside curly braces `{}` (a block).
Variables declared in these blocks can not be accessed/used outside of the blocks.
